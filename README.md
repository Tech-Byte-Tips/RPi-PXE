# RPI-PXE

A PXE Server for Raspberry Pis

## The Branches

```
NOTE:

For now, I don't consider updating the CLI often.  Effort will be primarily placed on the main branch.
```

* The **main** branch will be a fresh start for the project, given some ideas and ambitions that I have for it.

  This will be a full-fledged, python-based, web application.

* The **cli** branch will contain the code for the CLI version of this application (how I started).

  More details for those will be provided in README files there.

## About

This application is designed to work with all Raspberry Pi models.  It is simple and lightweight.

When installed, it will turn your Raspberry Pi into a PXE Server that will help other Raspberry Pis to boot from the network.

You can choose to hold the files in:

  1. An attached storage device in your Raspberry Pi
  2. A NAS server in your network (recommended)

Development progress is being tracked in this [Kanban board](https://kanboard.techbytetips.com/public/board/087415f16ea8d1ecaa59796114e631c8bd6bad1852611637173d8145cffe).
